#Programming Background
**I haven't had a lot of programming experience, I took a Visual Basic class and half a C++ class in high school. During the summer I took CS 165 so I feel comfortable with C++**

*I enjoyed CS 165. I made a game for the final project which I liked a lot, but there were some weird things I had to put in to get all the reqs in*
